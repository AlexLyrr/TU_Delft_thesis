# TU_Delft_thesis

The code has been developed for the master thesis under the title "Low-cost stereo-based obstacle avoidance for small UAVs using uncertainty maps"

The thesis can be found in the following link: https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:96a87f24-c9b1-4a3e-99df-09dc27772609?collection=education

Usage:

Stereo bm inputs: left, right image and disparity truth
Stereo sgbm inputs: left, right image and disparity truth
c-space expansion inputs: disparity map
collision_detection_and_avoidance input: disparity map, uncertainty map

The code needs only openCV library as requirement.
