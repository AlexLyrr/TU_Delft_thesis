I would like to thank professor Guido de Croon for giving me the opportunity to carry out my master thesis under his supervision. His mature advises and his insightful and extensive research have strongly increased my motivation and commitment to work on this project. I also would like to thank professor Stephan Wong for enabling me to do this research and supporting my work. The completion of this thesis however would be impossible without the enormous support and cooperation with Tom Van Dijk. His experience and constant assistance made it possible for me to accomplish this work. I would like to thank also my family and friends, who have always trusted and encouraged me throughout my whole academic course. Finally and last but not least, I would like to thank Ismini Katsarou for believing in me, her constant encouragement and for all our fruitful discussions.
